# LTspice Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal LTspice simulations and circuit analysis exercises.  
Each project focuses on understanding key electronic concepts through practical simulation.

## 📘 Contents
- **Diode Circuits** – Half-wave, full-wave, and bridge rectifiers  
- **Filters** – RC, RL, and RLC filters with cutoff frequency measurement  
- **Amplifiers** – Small-signal and frequency response analysis  
- **AC & DC Analysis** – Bode plots, biasing, and transient response  
- **Miscellaneous** – Experimental circuits and measurements  

## ⚙️ Tools
- **Software:** LTspice (v24.1.10 or later)
- **Platform:** Windows

## 🧠 Goal
To build strong practical understanding of circuit theory using simulations and visual analysis.
